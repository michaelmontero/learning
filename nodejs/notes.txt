-NodeJS code (v8 engine) is written in c++
-The V8 engine convert hight level NodeJS code in the proper Machine code.
-A module is self-contained reusable block of code. It means the code you have in a module does not affect without intention other code.

#REQUIRE
require is a function that receive a path as argument and it returns
module.exports. All that works because all code written in NodeJS
is wrapped by a function expression that receive (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname)
as parameter.

The first time a module is required node cached that module, so if the module
is required again in other file the engine return the object  cached before.
