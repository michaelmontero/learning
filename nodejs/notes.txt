There is differences between JSON and Javascript objects literal and is that the json keys should be only string and the data
can't not be a function. The object literal key could be any valid javascript expression (Including function, null, undefined) and the value could be anything.

-NodeJS code (v8 engine) is written in c++
-The V8 engine convert hight level NodeJS code in the proper Machine code.
-A module is self-contained reusable block of code. It means the code you have in a module does not affect without intention other code.

#REQUIRE
require is a function that receive a path as argument and it returns
module.exports. All that works because all code written in NodeJS
is wrapped by a function expression that receive (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname)
as parameter.

The first time a module is required node cached that module, so if the module
is required again in other file the engine return the object  cached before.

#EVENT
An event is when the app respond to something that happens.
